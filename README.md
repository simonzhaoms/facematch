This is a simple face recognition example of using deep learning to
recognise faces within a picture.  It originates from Adrian
Rosebrock's article --
[Face recognition with OpenCV, Python, and deep learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/18/face-recognition-with-opencv-python-and-deep-learning/).

See the github repository for examples of its usage:
